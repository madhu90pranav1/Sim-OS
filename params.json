Sourcecode ( project4sourcecode.cpp)\r\n2. Readme file (Readme.txt)\r\n3. Configuration file ( config.sys)\r\n4. Sample program file (sampleprogram1.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project can be compiled and executed by the following steps:\r\n \r\n Step 1. Create a directory by typing the following command:\r\n \r\n {cslinux1:~} mkdir project3\r\n\r\n Step 2: Enter the directory by typing the following command:\r\n \r\n {cslinux1:~} cd project3\r\n\r\n \r\nStep 3: Open  a text editor , copy contents of the source code and save the file as project3sourcecode.cpp\r\n\r\nStep 4: Open a text editor and copy the contents of config.sys and save it as  config.sys\r\n\r\nStep 5: Open a text editor and copy the contents of the file containing the sample program and save it sampleprogram1.txt\r\nStep 6. compile the project by typing the following command in the shell:\r\n\r\n{cslinux1:~/project3} g++ -g project4sourcecode.cpp -o simos -pthread\r\n\r\nThe above command will generate an executable file with the name \" simos\"\r\n\r\nStep 7. Run the project by typing the following:\r\n\r\n{cslinux1:~/project3} ./simos\r\n\r\nWhen the program is running the following propmpt will appear:\r\n\r\ncommand>\r\n\r\nStep 8. Enter the folllowing command\r\n\r\ncommand>s\r\n The filename will be asked . Enter the sampleprogram1.txt and press enter.\r\nThe sampleprogram1 is submitted and ready for execution . The program will return to command>\r\n\r\nAny other command can be then tried out.\r\n\r\nThe folowing options are the various commands\r\np,r,l,m,q,x\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
